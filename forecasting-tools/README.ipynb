    "Install this package with `pip install forecasting-tools`\n",
    "\n",
    "Demo website: https://forecasting-tools.streamlit.app/\n",

    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains forecasting and research tools built with Python and Streamlit. The project aims to assist users in making predictions, conducting research, and analyzing data related to hard to answer questions (especially those from Metaculus).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the tools most likely to be useful to you:\n",
    "- 🎯 **Forecasting Bot:** General forecaster that integrates with the Metaculus AI benchmarking competition and provides a number of utilities. You can forecast with a pre-existing bot or override the class to customize your own (without redoing all the aggregation/API code, etc)\n",
    "- 🔌 **Metaculus API Wrapper:** for interacting with questions and tournaments\n",
    "- 📊 **Benchmarking:** Randomly sample quality questions from Metaculus and run your bot against them so you can get an early sense of how your bot is doing by comparing to the community prediction and expected baseline scores.\n",
    "- 🤖 **In-House Metaculus Bots**: You can see all the bots that Metaculus is running on their site in `run_bots.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other features of the project (not all are documented yet):\n",
    "- **Smart Searcher:** A custom AI-powered internet-informed llm powered by Exa.ai and GPT. It is more configurable than Perplexity AI, allowing you to use any AI model, instruct the AI to decide on filters, get citations linking to exact paragraphs, etc.\n",
    "- **Key Factor Analysis:** Key Factors Analysis for scoring, ranking, and prioritizing important variables in forecasting questions\n",
    "- **Base Rate Researcher:** for calculating event probabilities (still experimental)\n",
    "- **Niche List Researcher:** for analyzing very specific lists of past events or items (still experimental)\n",
    "- **Fermi Estimator:** for breaking down numerical estimates (still experimental)\n",
    "- **Monetary Cost Manager:** for tracking AI and API expenses\n",
    "- **Prompt Optimizer:** for letting AI iterate through 100+ forecasting bot prompts\n",
    "- **Question Decomposer/Operationalizer:** To turn a question or topic into relevant forecastable sub-questions\n",
    "- **Other experimental tools:** See the demo site for other AI forecasting tools that this project supports (not all are documented). Also see the `scripts` folder for other common workflows and entry points into the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the examples below are in a Jupyter Notebook called `README.ipynb` which you can run locally to test the package (make sure to run the first cell though).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide you want to join the Metaculus AI Benchmarking Tournament, it is recommended that you start [here](https://github.com/Metaculus/metac-bot-template). This repo is easy to start with and has a 30min tutorial for how to set it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Join the [discord](https://discord.gg/Dtq4JNdXnw) for updates and to give feedback (btw feedback is very appreciated, even just a quick \"I did/didn't decide to use tool X for reason Y, though am busy and don't have time to elaborate\" is helpful to know)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This package is still in an experimental phase. The goal is to keep the package API fairly stable, though no guarantees are given at this phase especially with experimental tools. There will be special effort to keep the ForecastBot and TemplateBot APIs consistent."

Please note that cost is only tracked after a call finishes, so if you concurrently batch 1000 calls, they will all go through even if the cost is exceeded during the middle of the execution of the batch. Additionally not all models support cost tracking. You will get a logger warning if your model is not supported. Litellm models with weird non-token pricing structures may be inaccurate as well."

    "## Docker Dev Container\n",
    "Dev containers are reliable ways to make sure environments work on everyone's machine the first try and so you don't have to spend hours setting up your environment (especially if you have Docker already installed). If you would rather just use poetry, without the dev container, you can skip to \"Alternatives to Docker\". Otherwise, to get your development environment up and running, you need to have Docker Engine installed and running. Once you do, you can use the VSCode dev container pop-up to automatically set up everything for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Docker\n",
    "For Windows and Mac, you will download Docker Desktop. For Linux, you will download Docker Engine. (NOTE: These instructions might be outdated).\n",
    "\n",
    "First download and setup Docker Engine using the instructions at the link below for your OS:\n",
    " * Windows: [windows-install](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)\n",
    " * Mac: [mac-install](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)\n",
    " * Linux: [install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\n",
    "    * Do not install Docker Desktop for Linux, rather, select your Linux distribution on the left sidebar and follow the distribution specific instructions for Docker engine. Docker Desktop runs with a different environment in Linux.\n",
    "    * Remember to follow the post-installation steps for Linux: [linux-postinstall](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting the container\n",
    "Once Docker is installed, when you open up the project folder in VSCode, you will see a pop up noting that you have a setup for a dev container, and asking if you would like to open the folder in a container. You will want to click \"open in container\". This will automatically set up everything you need and bring you into the container. If it doesn't show up, press `ctrl+shift+P` and type in `devcontainers: build and reopen in remote container`\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Docker process times out in the middle of installing python packages you can run the `.devcontiner/postinstall.sh` manually. You may need to have the VSCode Docker extension and/or devcontainer extension downloaded in order for the pop up to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are in the container, poetry should have already installed a virtual environment. For VSCode features to use this environment, you will need to select the correct python interpreter. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and then typing `Python: Select Interpreter`. Then select the interpreter that starts with `.venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of vscode extensions are installed automatically (e.g. linting). You may need to wait a little while and then reload the window (once for things to install, and a second for needed reload after installation). You can install personal vscode extensions in the dev environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Docker\n",
    "There are many ways to manager Docker containers, but generally if you download the vscode Docker extension, you will be able to stop/start/remove all containers and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternatives to Docker\n",
    "If you choose not to run Docker, you can use poetry to set up a local virtual environment. If you are on Ubuntu, you should be able to just read through and then run `.devcontainer/postinstall.sh`. If you aren't on Ubuntu, check out the links in the postinstall file for where install instructions for dependencies were originally found. You may also want to take a look at VSCode extensions that would be installed (see the list in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file) so that some VSCode workplace settings work out of the box (e.g. automatic Black Formatting).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Front End\n",
    "You can run any front end folder in the front_end directory by executing `streamlit run front_end/main.py`. This will start a development server for you that you can run. Streamlit makes it very easy to publish demos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",

    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository on GitHub. Clone your fork locally: `git clone git@github.com:your-username/forecasting-tools.git`\n",
    "2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Follow the \"Local Development\" section in the README to set up your environment\n",
    "3. **Come up with an improvement**: Decide on something worth changing. Perhaps, you want to add your own custom bot to the forecasting_bots folder. Perhaps you want to add a tool that you think others could benefit from. As long as your code is clean, you can probably expect your contribution to be accepted, though if you are worried about adoption, feel free to chat on our discord or create an issue.\n",
    "4. **Make a pull request**: \n",
    "   - Make changes\n",
    "   - Push your changes to your fork\n",
    "   - Make sure you rebase with the upstream main branch before doing a PR (`git fetch upstream` and `git rebase upstream/main`)\n",
    "   - Go to your fork in github, and choose the branch that you have that has your changes\n",
    "   - You should see a 'Contribute' button. Click this and make a pull request.\n",
    "   - Fill out the pull request template with a  description of what changed and why and Url for related issues \n",
    "   - Request review from maintainers\n",
    "   - Respond to any feedback and make requested changes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Style**\n",
    "   - Code is automatically formatted on commit using precommit (this should be automatically installed when you start the devcontainer). Formatting is done using Black, Ruff, and some other tools.\n",
    "   - Use type hints for all function parameters and return values\n",
    "   - Use descriptive variable names over comments\n",
    "   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Testing**\n",
    "   - Add tests where appropriate for new functionality. We aren't shooting for full code coverage, but you shouldn't make none.\n",
    "   - Run unit tests locally before merging to check if you broke anything. See the 'Testing' section.\n",
    "   - Integration tests often ping live LLM APIs and so will incur a non negligible cost but moderate cost. If you are able please run these as well.\n",
