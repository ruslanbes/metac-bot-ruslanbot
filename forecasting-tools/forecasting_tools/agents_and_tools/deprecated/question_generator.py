                Please improve the fine print and ideally add a link to it (only if there is a clear place that could help resolve the question).
                Look for clear places that could help resolve the question.
                You have to be more than 100% confident that the resolution criteria/fine print will be unambiguous in retrospect.
                Walk through ways that this could go wrong such as:
                - The resolution source doesn't update
                - The resolution source retracts or changes information
                - One of your assumptions was wrong
                - A key date changes

                Before giving your final answer in a json code block, please walk through at least 3 possible situations that could happen and how you would resolve them.
                Compare to ways that similar things have happened in the past that surprised people.
