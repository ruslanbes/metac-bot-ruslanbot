class FallTemplateBot2025(ForecastBot):
    """
    This is a copy of the template bot for Fall 2025 Metaculus AI Tournament.
    This bot is what is used by Metaculus in our benchmark, but is also provided as a template for new bot makers.
    This template is given as-is, and though we have covered most test cases
    in forecasting-tools it may be worth double checking key components locally.

    Main changes since Q2:
    - An LLM now parses the final forecast output (rather than programmatic parsing)
    - Added resolution criteria and fine print explicitly to the research prompt
    - Previously in the prompt, nothing about upper/lower bound was shown when the bounds were open. Now a suggestion is made when this is the case.
    - Support for nominal bounds was added (i.e. when there are discrete questions and normal upper/lower bounds are not as intuitive)

    The main entry point of this bot is `forecast_on_tournament` in the parent class.
    See the script at the bottom of the file for more details on how to run the bot.
    Ignoring the finer details, the general flow is:
    - Load questions from Metaculus
    - For each question
        - Execute run_research a number of times equal to research_reports_per_question
        - Execute respective run_forecast function `predictions_per_research_report * research_reports_per_question` times
        - Aggregate the predictions
        - Submit prediction (if publish_reports_to_metaculus is True)
    - Return a list of ForecastReport objects

    Only the research and forecast functions need to be implemented in ForecastBot subclasses,
    though you may want to override other ones.
    In this example, you can change the prompts to be whatever you want since,
    structure_output uses an LLMto intelligently reformat the output into the needed structure.

    By default (i.e. 'tournament' mode), when you run this script, it will forecast on any open questions for the
    MiniBench and Seasonal AIB tournaments. If you want to forecast on only one or the other, you can remove one
    of them from the 'tournament' mode code at the bottom of the file.

    You can experiment with what models work best with your bot by using the `llms` parameter when initializing the bot.
    You can initialize the bot with any number of models. For example,
    ```python
    my_bot = MyBot(
        ...
        llms={  # choose your model names or GeneralLlm llms here, otherwise defaults will be chosen for you
            "default": GeneralLlm(
                model="openrouter/openai/gpt-4o", # "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", etc (see docs for litellm)
                temperature=0.3,
                timeout=40,
                allowed_tries=2,
            ),
            "summarizer": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
            "researcher": "asknews/deep-research/low",
            "parser": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        },
    )
    ```

    Then you can access the model in custom functions like this:
    ```python
    research_strategy = self.get_llm("researcher", "model_name"
    if research_strategy == "asknews/deep-research/low":
        ...
    # OR
    summarizer = await self.get_llm("summarizer", "model_name").invoke(prompt)
    # OR
    reasoning = await self.get_llm("default", "llm").invoke(prompt)
    ```

    If you end up having trouble with rate limits and want to try a more sophisticated rate limiter try:
    ```python
    from forecasting_tools import RefreshingBucketRateLimiter
    rate_limiter = RefreshingBucketRateLimiter(
        capacity=2,
        refresh_rate=1,
    ) # Allows 1 request per second on average with a burst of 2 requests initially. Set this as a class variable
    await self.rate_limiter.wait_till_able_to_acquire_resources(1) # 1 because it's consuming 1 request (use more if you are adding a token limit)
    ```
    Additionally OpenRouter has large rate limits immediately on account creation
