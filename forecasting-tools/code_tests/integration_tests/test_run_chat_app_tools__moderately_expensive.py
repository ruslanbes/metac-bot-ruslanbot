        You are a software engineer testing a piece of code.
        You are being given a tool you have access to.
        Please make up some inputs to the tool, and then run the tool with the inputs.
        Check whether the results of the tool match its description.

        If the results make sense generally, and there are no errors say: "<TOOL SUCCESSFULLY TESTED>"
        If there are errors, or the results indicate that the tool does something very different than expected say: "<TOOL FAILED TEST>" and then state the error/output verbatim then explain why the output is not right.

        Here is what to do for some specific tools:
        - For metaculus question tools, use the question ID 37328 and tournament slug '{MetaculusApi.CURRENT_METACULUS_CUP_ID}'
        - For data analyzer tool, use the file ID "file-KCPeaFiP8Szp7PnhXVPFH5" and file name "bot_forecasts_q1.csv" and ask for number of binary questions
        - For computer use tool, ask it to download a csv from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP and make sure it returns to you a download link and a OpenAI File ID.

# - File upload works in chat app
# - Data analyzer works with pdf
# - Ability to use and upload multiple files
# - Files are not uploaded again if they are already uploaded
