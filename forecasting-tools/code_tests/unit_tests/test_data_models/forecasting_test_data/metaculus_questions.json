Former Indian naval chief Arun Prakash [commented](https://archive.ph/WR4oJ#selection-1101.1-1109.101), \"For years, the US has been telling India that American laws make it impossible to share nuclear-propulsion tech with anyone, including allies.\"  Srinath Raghavan, professor of international relations at Ashoka University [said](https://archive.ph/WR4oJ#selection-2383.1-2383.215) \"It\u2019s normal realpolitik, [...] The US gave short shrift to an ally like France in the process, [so] it would be silly of India to see this as a snub.\"",

        "background_info": "[pump.fun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump.fun) (commonly referred to as Pump) is a cryptocurrency trading platform for the Solana blockchain that enables users to create tokens and trade them immediately on the platform, as well as to launch them onto decentralized exchanges like Raydium. It has become famous for \"rug-pulls\" also called \"pump and dump\" schemes, which are a way the creator of a crypto token \"exit-scams\" their users, by selling their entire share at once. This was facilitated by the easy token creation process on the site.\n\nThe platform has come under scrutiny recently in relation to the livestreaming service it also offered as a way for users to advertise their tokens. It was indefinitely disabled as a result of misuse in extreme ways, such as animal abuse, torture, sexual activities and even [a faked suicide](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/fake-suicide-on-pump-fun-prompted-outrage-and-a-shutdown/ \"a faked suicide\"). pump.fun has also suspended operations in the UK.\n\nLive and historical data about the site can be found on the [pump.fun dashboard](https://dune.com/adam_tehc/pumpfun) by [adam\\_tehc](https://dune.com/adam_tehc).",

                "description": "[pump.fun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump.fun) (commonly referred to as Pump) is a cryptocurrency trading platform for the Solana blockchain that enables users to create tokens and trade them immediately on the platform, as well as to launch them onto decentralized exchanges like Raydium. It has become famous for \"rug-pulls\" also called \"pump and dump\" schemes, which are a way the creator of a crypto token \"exit-scams\" their users, by selling their entire share at once. This was facilitated by the easy token creation process on the site.\n\nThe platform has come under scrutiny recently in relation to the livestreaming service it also offered as a way for users to advertise their tokens. It was indefinitely disabled as a result of misuse in extreme ways, such as animal abuse, torture, sexual activities and even [a faked suicide](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/fake-suicide-on-pump-fun-prompted-outrage-and-a-shutdown/ \"a faked suicide\"). pump.fun has also suspended operations in the UK.\n\nLive and historical data about the site can be found on the [pump.fun dashboard](https://dune.com/adam_tehc/pumpfun) by [adam\\_tehc](https://dune.com/adam_tehc).",

It was passed by Congress in 1972 and submitted to the states with a seven-year ratification deadline, later extended to three years, causing the deadline to be 1982. 35 states initially approved the amendment before the deadline passed. However, several states rescinded their ratification while others ratified the amendment after the deadline, raising questions about whether a statutory ratification deadline is constitutional and whether states can rescind ratification. In the final days of his Presidency, [<u>Joe Biden declared that the ERA was part of the Constitution</u>](https://time.com/7207834/biden-says-equal-rights-amendment-is-law-of-the-land/). However, this statement has no legal effect unless the Archivist certifies the Amendment, which they have yet to do.",

                "description": "The [<u>Equal Rights Amendment</u>](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/equal-rights-amendment-explained) (ERA) is a proposed amendment that would prohibit sex discrimination. It was passed by Congress in 1972 and submitted to the states with a seven-year ratification deadline, later extended to three years, causing the deadline to be 1982. 35 states initially approved the amendment before the deadline passed. However, several states rescinded their ratification while others ratified the amendment after the deadline, raising questions about whether a statutory ratification deadline is constitutional and whether states can rescind ratification. In the final days of his Presidency, [<u>Joe Biden declared that the ERA was part of the Constitution</u>](https://time.com/7207834/biden-says-equal-rights-amendment-is-law-of-the-land/). However, this statement has no legal effect unless the Archivist certifies the Amendment, which they have yet to do.",

They serve at the discretion of the majority party of the Senate, and in recent years have played an increasingly important role ruling on what items can be included in budget reconciliation legislation under the Byrd Rule. Major pieces of legislation passed through the budget reconciliation process in recent years include the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Critically, however, the decisions made by the Senate Parliamentarian can be ignored and the Senate Parliamentarian may be removed and replaced by the Senate majority. The current Senate Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, has held the position since 2012.",

They serve at the discretion of the majority party of the Senate, and in recent years have played an increasingly important role ruling on what items can be included in budget reconciliation legislation under the Byrd Rule. Major pieces of legislation passed through the budget reconciliation process in recent years include the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Critically, however, the decisions made by the Senate Parliamentarian can be ignored and the Senate Parliamentarian may be removed and replaced by the Senate majority. The current Senate Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, has held the position since 2012.",

        "background_info": "The question of whether diversity-related programs at elite universities constitute illegal discrimination has been a contentious issue in recent years, particularly following the Supreme Court's decision in [*<u>Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard</u>*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/600/20-1199/), which ended race-conscious admissions policies at U.S. colleges and universities. The Department of Justice and Department of Education have both historically taken an interest in investigating compliance with civil rights laws at universities. Recent developments, including [<u>legal challenges</u>](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/01/22/harvard-antisemitism-lawsuits-settlements/77882484007/) and policy shifts at institutions like Harvard, have raised questions about whether such programs might face increased scrutiny.",

                "description": "The question of whether diversity-related programs at elite universities constitute illegal discrimination has been a contentious issue in recent years, particularly following the Supreme Court's decision in [*<u>Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard</u>*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/600/20-1199/), which ended race-conscious admissions policies at U.S. colleges and universities. The Department of Justice and Department of Education have both historically taken an interest in investigating compliance with civil rights laws at universities. Recent developments, including [<u>legal challenges</u>](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/01/22/harvard-antisemitism-lawsuits-settlements/77882484007/) and policy shifts at institutions like Harvard, have raised questions about whether such programs might face increased scrutiny.",

Kariba is the largest man-made lake in the world by volume and lies 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Lusaka on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe.\" \"The lake's water level naturally rises and recedes according to the season, but generally it should go up by around six meters after the rains. It moved by less than 30 centimeters after the last rainy season barely materialized, authorities said. They hope this year's rains, which should start in November, will be good. But they estimate that it'll still take three good years for Kariba to fully recover its hydroelectric capability.\" ",

It was published by RSA Laboratories as part of their [RSA Factoring Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_Factoring_Challenge) to encourage research in computational number theory and the practical difficulty of factoring large numbers.\n\nThe challenge has significant implications for cybersecurity, as the [RSA encryption system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\\(cryptosystem\\))'s security relies on the computational difficulty of factoring such large numbers. While classical computers would require impractical amounts of time to factor RSA-2048, quantum computers using Shor's algorithm [could theoretically accomplish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) this task in a feasible timeframe.\n\nCurrent quantum computers face several key challenges:\n\n1. Achieving sufficient quantum bits (qubits) while maintaining coherence\n2. Implementing error correction at scale\n3. Developing the precise quantum circuits needed for Shor's algorithm\n\nExperts estimate that factoring RSA-2048 [would require](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2021/08/24/quantum-attack-resource-estimate-using-shors-algorithm-to-break-rsa-vs-dh-dsa-vs-ecc/) a minimum of 4098 of stable, error-corrected qubits, while current quantum computers typically have fewer than 1,000 noisy qubits. The achievement of this milestone would represent a fundamental breakthrough in quantum computing capability and would have profound implications for current cryptographic systems.\n\nRSA-2048 is the following number:\n`25195908475657893494027183240048398571429282126204032027777137836043662020707595556264018525880784406918290641249515082189298559149176184502808489120072844992687392807287776735971418347270261896375014971824691165077613379859095700097330459748808428401797429100642458691817195118746121515172654632282216869987549182422433637259085141865462043576798423387184774447920739934236584823824281198163815010674810451660377306056201619676256133844143603833904414952634432190114657544454178424020924616515723350778707749817125772467962926386356373289912154831438167899885040445364023527381951378636564391212010397122822120720357`",

        "background_info": "As generative AI has been getting better and more common, there's been a significant increase in the number of labor strikes that seek protection from this new technology. The [2023 Writers Guild of America strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike) resulted in a an [agreement](https://apnews.com/article/hollywood-ai-strike-wga-artificial-intelligence-39ab72582c3a15f77510c9c30a45ffc8) that\n\n> requires studios and production companies to disclose to writers if any material given to them has been generated by AI partially or in full. AI cannot be a credited writer. AI cannot write or rewrite “literary material.” AI-generated writing cannot be source material.\n\nIn parallel, the [2023 SAG-AFTRA strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike) secured [various agreements](https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/member-resources/artificial-intelligence/sag-aftra-ai-bargaining-and) that protect the rights of actors against the unauthorized use of their \"digital replica\" – AI-generated videos and recordings of their likeness that could potentially substitute human performers. In 2024, [another SAG-AFTRA begun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%93present_SAG-AFTRA_video_game_strike), this time on behalf of voice actors and motion capture artists, also seeking protections from generative AI. The strike is still ongoing as of May 2025.",

AI cannot be a credited writer. AI cannot write or rewrite “literary material.” AI-generated writing cannot be source material.\n\nIn parallel, the [2023 SAG-AFTRA strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike) secured [various agreements](https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/member-resources/artificial-intelligence/sag-aftra-ai-bargaining-and) that protect the rights of actors against the unauthorized use of their \"digital replica\" – AI-generated videos and recordings of their likeness that could potentially substitute human performers. In 2024, [another SAG-AFTRA begun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%93present_SAG-AFTRA_video_game_strike), this time on behalf of voice actors and motion capture artists, also seeking protections from generative AI.

Trump [put](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/10/trump-trade-tariffs-china-software.html) an extra 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on November 1, 2025, adding that the US would start blocking sales of \"any and all critical software\" to China. President Trump's tariff threat came in response to China [announcing](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains) new restrictions on rare earth and magnet exports. Trump and the paramount leader of China, Xi Jinping, are [planning](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/10/trump-threatens-to-nix-meeting-with-chinas-xi-jinping-over-trade-tensions) to meet on October 31st at the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, though Trump has threatened to cancel the meeting.\n\nAccording to the international law firm of[ Reed Smith](https://www.tradecomplianceresourcehub.com/2025/10/10/trump-2-0-tariff-tracker/), baseline tariffs of 10% are currently implemented, with other tariffs ranging to 15% and 20% on \"Fentanyl\"-related products. Previous announced tariffs, such as a 200% tariff on China [threatened](https://cepr.net/publications/trump-proposes-200-percent-tariff-on-imports-from-china-xi-pushes-for-300-percent/) in August 2025, have been delayed.&#x20;",
