# RuslanBot

Forecasting bot based on [Metaculus template bot](https://github.com/Metaculus/metac-bot-template), but heavily changed.


### Installing dependencies
Make sure you have python and [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-pipx) installed (poetry is a python package manager).

If you don't have poetry installed, run the below:
```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y pipx
pipx install poetry

# Optional
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Inside the terminal, go to the directory you cloned the repository into and run the following command:
```bash
poetry install
```
to install all required dependencies.

### Setting environment variables

Running the bot requires various environment variables. If you run the bot locally, the easiest way to set them is to create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the repository (copy the `.env.template`).

### Running the bot

To test the simple bot, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
poetry run python main.py --mode test_questions
```
Make sure to set the environment variables as described above and to set the parameters in the code to your liking. In particular, to submit predictions, make sure that `submit_predictions` is set to `True` (it is set to `True` by default in main.py).
